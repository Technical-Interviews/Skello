**Sinatra Exercise**

Sinatra is a simple web framework for Ruby, similar in logic to Rails. You can view the documentation [here](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) and the Github repo [here](https://github.com/sinatra/sinatra).

*Don't forget to run ```gem install sinatra``` && ```gem install sinatra-contrib``` in order to run the program*

In this simple exercise, a database of posts and comments is given to you (see Database.rb). Comments are ordered to match each post (first comment array - first post, etc.).

Your goal is to create a credible web application, similar in logic to HackerNews or Reddit. The app must make intelligent use of the components of each post, and overall look like a real web app. The rest is completely up to you.

This is a test of your front-end, back-end capabilities, as well as your creativity. Though the app is simple, we will be looking for surprising features, a clean back-end code, as well as a refined front-end.

Overall, we're just looking for you to surprise us!
